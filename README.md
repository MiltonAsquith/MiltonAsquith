## Background
With over 15 years of experience in IT spanning various sectors, I have continually evolved my expertise to meet the dynamic demands of the industry. My journey has encompassed diverse roles including business analysis, software development, application support, and quality assurance. I have found Quality Assurance the best fit for my skills and mindset and have been developing in this role since 2015. My previous experience afford me an unusually broad perspective which I believe makes me a better tester and to do the "glue" work within/across teams.

In my current role as a Senior QA Analyst, I've been instrumental in revolutionizing test automation strategies for front-end and back-end applications. This has included using Postman/Newman and/or SoapUI to test applications, services, or APIs written in Java, Node.js, AngularJS, and C# .NET, often requiring the development of complex collections to implement intricate test scenarios with precision. Additionally, I've acquired an understanding of service discovery and orchestration by using Consul and Nomad by HashiCorp. Most notably, I've pioneered the development of a robust test automation framework for a web-based application, leveraging Python, WebDriver, and a Dockerized Selenium Grid. The incorporation of Allure reporting has enabled comprehensive test result visualization enhancing overall project transparency.

My commitment to excellence is underscored by my exceptional verbal and written communication skills. I possess a proven ability to adapt my language to cater to the technical proficiency levels of diverse stakeholders, ensuring effective collaboration and knowledge dissemination across teams and stakeholders.
